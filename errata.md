# Errata for *Applied Data Science Using PySpark*

On **page 88** [Figure 3-15: Overview of Analytics]: (Oct.2023)
 
I would understand that the graph shows Predictive twice while I would expect that **prescriptive** should be named instead for **Intelligence**!?

On **page 48** [df.describe()]: (Oct.2023)
 
On page 48 there is a command **df.describe()** which would work for a pandas-dataframe. But for a spark-df I dont see the table that is shown as **Figure 2-13. Describe Function Output**. I had to use something like **df.describe().show()**.
